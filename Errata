This is not a final proposal. 
I am currently studying chapter 03 , and here are the errata I have found so far. Contact the author and he will approve them.
(It is also a way for me to advertise my work as a proofreaded, something that I have done all ready for 2 linux books)



Chapter 1
page 12 
F5B9E1 as a decimal value is given by
15 × 165 + 5 × 164 + 11 × 163 + 9 × 162 + 14 × 161 + 1 × 160
should be writen in a way to denote clearly the powers of 16, like :
15 × 16^5 + 5 × 16^4 + 11 × 16^3 + 9 × 16^2 + 14 × 16^1 + 1 × 16^0

Chapter 2
page 28   binary literals
the declaration 
  int mask {0B11111111000000001111111100000000}; // 4 bytes
should be substituted with 
  unsigned int mask {0B11111111000000001111111100000000}; // 4 bytes
  
Chapter 3
page 69  Ex3_02.cpp
the line 
   std::cout << "Is today's value(" << static_cast<int>(today)
            << ") the same as poets_day(" << static_cast<int>(poets_day)
            << ")" << static_cast<char>(ch) << std::endl;
should have in the middle the new variable:tomorrow, that was assigned with a copy of poets_day 
           << ") the same as poets_day(" << static_cast<int>(tomorrow)

page 70 
After the text :
  For example, the Day enumeration could be defined like this:
    enum class Day {Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday};
the correct is 
    enum  Day {Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday};

page 73 Ex3_03.cpp
the 5th line of main is 
   std::cout << "Value of global count2 = " << count1 << std::endl;
the correct is 
   std::cout << "Value of global count2 = " << count2 << std::endl;
   
Chapter 4 
page 102 Exercises 
  Exercise 4-1. Write a program that prompts for two integers to be entered and then uses an
  if-else statement to output a message that states whether or not the integers are the same.
The correct text should be (according to the solution provided in this github) 
  Exercise 4-1. Write a program that prompts for two positive integers to be entered and then uses an
  if-else statement to output a message that states whether or not the 1st integer is exactly divided by the 2nd.
  
  
Chapter 5
page 141 
The sentence : "The function is a member of the class type, array<double,100>,
of the object all array objects will have a fill() member, as well as other members."
should be substituted by : "The function is a member of the class type, array<double,100>,
of the object. All array objects will have a fill() member, as well as other members."
